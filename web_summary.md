### Segmentation Metrics

---

- **Fraction of cells empty**

Percent of all cells with no decoded transcripts.

- **Cells per 100 µm²**

The density of cells per 100 microns squared.

- **Median genes per cell**

The median number of unique genes detected per cell.

- **Median transcripts per cell**

The median number of transcripts per cell.

- **Cell Size Distribution**

For all cells with transcripts, a histogram of areas in μm². The area is computed from the cell segmentation mask.

- **Genes Per Cell**

For all cells with transcripts, a histogram of the total number of unique, panel genes found in each cell.

- **Transcripts Per Cell**

For all cells with transcripts, a histogram of the total number of transcripts found in each cell over all panel genes.
